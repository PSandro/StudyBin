# StudyBin
*StudyBin* is a Project to simplify the procedure of **organizing** and **managing school notes**. As a student at a German "Gymnasium" I'm used to taking a lot of notes for many school subjects by hand (the use of computers during lessons is not allowed yet). I often rewrite these notes with a text program at home them in order to have quick access to those texts but with increasing file numbers, things get a lot more difficult and it's easy to lose overview. *StudyBin* is here to fix this issue.
# Planned features
*StudyBin* should make it easy to...

 - **organize** your school notes
 - **connect** your school notes:
	 - Education sections
	 - combination of relevant notes (e.g. "StudyBin, show me all notes in music-lesson since the last exam on ...")
- **create/digitize** new notes:
	- File upload (Photo, Text-Files, PDF)
	- Built-In Texteditor
- get **access** to notes:
	- online synchronization
	- offline edit
